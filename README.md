**TripWiser** is a modular web application designed to simplify travel planning by generating personalized itineraries based on budget and preferences.

> 🚧 **Note :** This project is currently under active development. It represents my playground for mastering **Nuxt.js**, **API integration**, and **Modern Web Architecture**.

## 🎯 Project Goal
The main goal of TripWiser is to solve the "fragmentation problem" in travel planning. Instead of visiting 10 different sites, users get a centralized, AI-assisted plan.

From a technical perspective, I am building this to demonstrate:
- **Headless/API-centric Architecture:** Consuming external data sources efficiently.
- **Frontend State Management:** Using Vue ecosystem tools.
- **Modern UI/UX:** Creating a responsive interface with Nuxt.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [Nuxt.js](https://nuxt.com/) (Vue.js)
- **Language:** JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Styling:** CSS / Tailwind CSS (Work in progress)
- **Data:** REST API integration
- **AI Component:** *[In Development]* Integration for personalized recommendations

## 🚀 Features & Roadmap

Here is the current status of the development:

- [x] **Project Initialization:** Nuxt environment and directory structure setup.
- [x] **Routing:** Basic page navigation architecture.
- [ ] **API Integration:** Connection to Travel/Booking APIs (fetching destinations).
- [ ] **Budget Algorithm:** Logic to filter options based on user constraints.
- [ ] **AI Recommendation Engine:** Implementing the "smart" suggestion feature.
- [ ] **Authentication:** User accounts to save itineraries.
